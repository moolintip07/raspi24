Three scripts/classes, reference ```predictor.py```in the ```machineLearning```folder, and ```photoApp.py``` and ```photoDriver.py```. 

Instructionss:

- create an output folder
cd into the repo, and then install all libraries using: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. 

After installing all of the libraries: ```python3 photoDriver.py --output [output_folder_name]```. Please note that ```[output_folder_name]``` - name of folder you created btw
